The following user stories are implemented:\n\n* [ ] The information about each vessel is kept in a json file so we an modify those data if necessary. Vessels are uniquely identified by their name (as vesselID).\n* [ ] The capacity of a vessel is represented by a matrix, number of rows x number of columns to make it simpler. Therefore the total number of container is rows*columns.\n* [ ] Support GPS lat/log position reports, as vessel position event, of the position of the vessel a different point in time. This is modeled as csv file with one row of (lat,log) pair, a row representing a time stamp.
